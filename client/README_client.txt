Operations:
- PM (Public Message): The client sends a PM operation to broadcast a message to all active clients.
- DM (Direct Message): The client sends a DM operation to message a specific client.
- EX (Exit): The client sends an EX operation to close the connection (server updates its list of active clients and closes the connection).

Running the Client:
1. Open a separate terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing client.py
3. Run the client by executing: "python3 client.py localhost 12000" in a separate terminal window (use the same port number chosen for the server).
4. Repeat steps 1-3 to create multiple clients.

Instructions for Testing the Chat Room Client:
1. Login/Registration: The client will prompt for a username and password. If the username does not exist, youâ€™ll have an option to register. (Otherwise, use already existing login info: [user, pass])
2. Multiple Clients: Open multiple terminal windows and run client in each. Use unique usernames and test pm and dm.
3a. Sending Messages: Enter pm/dm and press return. You will then be prompted for your next input.
3b. Example for dm inputs: (dm [press enter] -> recipient_username [press enter] -> message [press enter])
3c. Example for pm inputs: (pm [press enter] -> message [press enter])
4. Enter ex to exit the chat.
